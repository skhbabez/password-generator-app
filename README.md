### What I learned

Styling Sliders was surprisingly challenging due to all the diffrent browser specific selectors. It took me a while to get it working on edge, firefox and chrome. Especially coloring only the left side of the slider required a javascript solution in the end. Luckily, stackoverflow exists.

```js
function updateSliderProgress(sliderValue) {
  const value = ((sliderValue - slider.min) / (slider.max - slider.min)) * 100;
  slider.style.background =
    "linear-gradient(to right, #a4ffaf 0%, #a4ffaf " +
    value +
    "%, #18171f " +
    value +
    "%, #18171f 100%)";
}
```

Styling the checkboxes was also surprisingly difficult, as there arenÂ´t that many ways to style them directly. I learned to use appearance property to hide and restyle them entirely.

```css
.condition-checkbox {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--spacing-300);
}

.condition-checkbox input {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  background-color: transparent;
  margin: 0;
  width: 1.25rem;
  height: 1.25rem;
  border: solid 0.125rem var(--grey-200);
  cursor: pointer;
}

.condition-checkbox input:checked {
  background-color: var(--green-200);
  border: none;
  background-image: url("assets/images/icon-check.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 50% 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I should continue working on my workflow. I applied a mobile first approach but especially the spacings required a lot of backtracking. I will try to define global responsive spacings and fonts earlier so i do not have to set them retroactively.
